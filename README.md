# hello-world
This is my hello-world repository. Github here I come. This repository really should be titled "world-watch-out".<br></br> 
This is me writing a bit about myself. I am an autodidactic learner who has now focused his attention to online media. This is my first real foray into Github, but I know it will not be my last.
